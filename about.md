<p>When I was a little girl, I learned how to translate ideas into successful businesses from my hard-working, ambitious, and entrepreneurial mom. I applied her teaching by thinking of non-linear ways to solve her customer's problems.</p>

<p>In junior high, I noticed there was a growing need for the students at my school to personalize their cell phones. So, I hired my two best friends to test my assumptions and hypothesis. It was a hit! Once the first few classmates owned my personalized cell phone key chains, that I had created from some scrappy items that mom brought back with her on one of her many international trips, everyone wanted one.</p>

<p>Today, I still live by my mom’s business principles. However, now I do it on a bigger scale. As a developer turned Product Manager (PM), I am driven by connecting with people. My passion is marrying my knowledge in technology and love for business to create customized software solutions that solve people’s problems or needs.</p>
